# Python Classes and Methods

Python is an “object-oriented programming language.” This means that almost all the code is implemented using a special construct called classes. Programmers use classes to keep related things together. This is done using the keyword “class,” which is a grouping of object-oriented constructs.

By the end of this tutorial you will be able to:

1. Define what is a class
2. Describe how to create a class
3. Define what is a method
4. Describe how to do object instantiation
5. Describe how to create instance attributes in Python
