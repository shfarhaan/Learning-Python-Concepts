## Why You Should Use Python 

Python, named after the British comedy group Monty Python, is a high-level, interpreted, interactive, and object-oriented programming language. Its flexibility allows you to do many things, both big and small. With Python, you can write basic programs and scripts and also to create complex and large-scale enterprise solutions. Here’s a sampling of its uses:

Building desktop applications, including GUI applications, CLI tools, and even games
Doing mathematical and scientific analysis of data
Building web and Internet applications
Doing computer systems administration and automating tasks
Performing DevOps tasks
You can find Python everywhere in the world of computer programming. For example, Python is the foundation of some of the world’s most popular websites, including Reddit, Dropbox, and YouTube, to name a few. The Python web framework Django powers both Instagram and Pinterest.

Python has a bunch of features that make it attractive as your first programming language:

Free: Python is available free of charge, even for commercial purposes.
Open source: Anyone can contribute to Python development.
Accessible: People of all ages, from school children to retirees, have learned Python, and so can you.
Versatile: Python can help you solve problems in many fields, including scripting, data science, web development, GUI development, and more.
Powerful: You can code small scripts to automate repetitive tasks, and you can also create complex and large-scale enterprise solutions with Python.
Compared to other programming languages, Python has the following features:

Interpreted: It’s portable and quicker to experiment with than compiled languages.
Multiparadigm: It lets you write code in different styles, including object-oriented, imperative, and functional style.
Dynamically typed: It checks variable types at runtime, so you don’t need to declare them explicitly.
Strongly typed: It won’t let unsafe operations on incompatible types go unnoticed.
There’s a lot more to learn about Python. But by now, you should have a better idea of why Python is so popular and why you should consider learning to program with it.


## How to Download and Install Python 
There are three installation methods on Windows:

The Microsoft Store
The full installer
Windows Subsystem for Linux
In this section, you’ll learn how to check which version of Python, if any, is installed on your Windows computer. You’ll also learn which of the three installation methods you should use.

How to Check Your Python Version on Windows
To check if you already have Python on your Windows machine, first open a command-line application, such as PowerShell.

Tip: Here’s how you open PowerShell:

Press the Win key.
Type PowerShell.
Press Enter.
Alternatively, you can right-click the Start button and select Windows PowerShell or Windows PowerShell (Admin).

You can also use cmd.exe or Windows Terminal.

With the command line open, type in the following command and press Enter:
