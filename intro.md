## Why You Should Use Python [#why-python]

Python, named after the British comedy group Monty Python, is a high-level, interpreted, interactive, and object-oriented programming language. Its flexibility allows you to do many things, both big and small. With Python, you can write basic programs and scripts and also to create complex and large-scale enterprise solutions. Here’s a sampling of its uses:

Building desktop applications, including GUI applications, CLI tools, and even games
Doing mathematical and scientific analysis of data
Building web and Internet applications
Doing computer systems administration and automating tasks
Performing DevOps tasks
You can find Python everywhere in the world of computer programming. For example, Python is the foundation of some of the world’s most popular websites, including Reddit, Dropbox, and YouTube, to name a few. The Python web framework Django powers both Instagram and Pinterest.

Python has a bunch of features that make it attractive as your first programming language:

Free: Python is available free of charge, even for commercial purposes.
Open source: Anyone can contribute to Python development.
Accessible: People of all ages, from school children to retirees, have learned Python, and so can you.
Versatile: Python can help you solve problems in many fields, including scripting, data science, web development, GUI development, and more.
Powerful: You can code small scripts to automate repetitive tasks, and you can also create complex and large-scale enterprise solutions with Python.
Compared to other programming languages, Python has the following features:

Interpreted: It’s portable and quicker to experiment with than compiled languages.
Multiparadigm: It lets you write code in different styles, including object-oriented, imperative, and functional style.
Dynamically typed: It checks variable types at runtime, so you don’t need to declare them explicitly.
Strongly typed: It won’t let unsafe operations on incompatible types go unnoticed.
There’s a lot more to learn about Python. But by now, you should have a better idea of why Python is so popular and why you should consider learning to program with it.
